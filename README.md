# Sorrel-loves-bookmarks

My loveletter to the Internet and everything it's given me and all I want to give back, for what I can, may anyone discover something beautiful through this list, may this be the match to light a fire for someone, or simply a fun passtime to enjoy some corners of the internet.
In additions, I have about 600 bookmarks that deal with archives of old software or hardware, but adding them one by one is quite tedious and I'm not sure I can find the time to do that. If anyone has any suggestion for how I may do that, please go ahead.  
Thank you :)
